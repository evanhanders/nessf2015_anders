	\begin{achievements}
	\item Teach important laboratory concepts in short mini-lectures
	\item Assist students individually in reaching laboratory goals
	\item Provide conceptual help to interested students by holding office hours
	\item Grade weekly assignments and provide feedback
	\end{achievements}


\employer{LIGO (Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory) Hanford Observatory}{Summer 2013}
\position{NSF SURF Fellow}{$\cdot$ Project: Spectral Line Monitoring  Tool (SLM)}
	\begin{achievements}
	\item Analyzed calibration data for LIGO using Fast Fourier Transforms by developing a new Python routine
	\item Studied the behavior of the Discrete Fourier Transform when applied to signals buried in Gaussian noise
	\item Researched past LIGO data to determine photon calibration consistency between input and output channels
	\end{achievements}

\employer{Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL)}{Summer 2012}
\position{DOE SULI Intern}{$\cdot$ Project: Global Arrays in NumPy (GAiN)}
	\begin{achievements}
	\item Optimized existing functions in GAiN, a Python module which applies PNNL's Global Arrays parallel programming toolkit to the NumPy Python module
	\item Designed new parallel algorithms for the GAiN `reduce' function
	\item Developed foundation of GAiN `master-slave' interface
	\item Benchmarked GAiN's functions, comparing their performance to an MPI-based NumPy implementation
	\end{achievements}

\employer{Whitworth University}{2011 - 2014}
\position{Computational Physics Teaching Assistant}{(January 2014)}
	\begin{worklist}
	\item Assisted students in translating mathematical operations into numerical algorithms
	\item Guided students in designing computational models of physical phenomena
	\end{worklist}

\position{Physics Lab Teaching Assistant}{(Fall 2011 - Spring 2012)}
	\begin{worklist}
	\item Instructed students through the completion of laboratory activities
	\item Reviewed and graded students' notebooks to help improve laboratory practices
	\end{worklist}

\position{Physics Tutor}{(Fall 2012 - May 2014)}
	\begin{worklist}
	\item Reviewed basic concepts with students to help improve problem-solving skills
	\item Provided supplemental instruction to assist students in the clarification of course material
	\end{worklist}

\position{Mathematics Grader}{(Spring 2012 - Spring 2013)}
	\begin{worklist}
	\item Reviewed and corrected homework assignments, leaving feedback to clarify concepts
	\item Graded for the following courses: Discrete Mathematics, Calculus I, and Calculus II
	\end{worklist}

\position{Class Projects}{}
	\begin{achievements}
	\item \emph{Electricity and Magnetism:} Designed and constructed an experiment for measuring atmospheric ozone content with visible light.  An insulated pod with a small fan for airflow contained an integrating sphere which was used to measure the intensity of red and green light.  Using recorded voltages and the absorption cross-sections of the various consituents of air, the content of ozone is determinable; unfortunately, due to unfavorable launch conditions and rushed construction, no meaningful data was acquired.
%	\item \emph{Computational Physics:} Created a MATLAB script which simulated the motion of interacting charges
%	\item \emph{Electronics:} Designed and constructed a robot that brewed tea
	\end{achievements}
